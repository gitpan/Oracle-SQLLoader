* Handle SQL*Loader-specific error codes and report on them. For instance, I
want to know if the instance is down (SQL*Loader-128), or if the table does
not exist (SQL*Loader-941) SQL*Loader-101

* win32 ppm

* par file support

* instead of just munging 'infile', create an option for a log/scratch
  directory that we can use for a default when we need to write to disk
  (bads, logs, etc)

* support more than one infile, and support diff bad, disc files for each

* check for $ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlldr and permissions in checkEnvironment

* lob data

* delimited load - add a constant designating a column to be skipped

* delimited load - allow passing of columns w/out 'column_name' href

* if we can get a DBI connection, we can just pull the column specs out of
  USER_TAB_COLUMNS

* move Tables and Columns out into classes

* since we can parse out unusable indexes, what should we do w/ them, rebuild?
