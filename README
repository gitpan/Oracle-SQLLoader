Oracle-SQLLoader README
=============================

OVERVIEW

Oracle::SQLLoader is an object interface to Oracle's SQL*Loader bulk loader
utility. It is designed to minimize the amount of SQL*Loader synatx and
number of options that you need to know about just to get data loaded into
tables.

It requires that you know a bit about your load scenario, such as the
destination table name, destination columns, and the general layout of the file
to be loaded. From there, the modules attempts to dwim as best as possible by
using defaults to all of the various sqlldr options.

The module currently supports the loading of a single table from a single file.
The file can be either fixed length or delimited. For a delimited file load,
just add the names of the destination columns in the order the fields appears
in the data file and optionally supply a data type. For a fixed length load,
supply the destination column name; the combination of the field starting
offset and field length, or the field start and end offsets in the data file;
and an optional data type.

Besides letting you skip the Oracle docs, the module provides a lot of useful
stats and return codes by parsing the sqlldr output.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

Oracle::SQLLoader has been successfully tested on the following platforms:

* Oracle 9.2.1.0 on Solaris 8 and 9
* Oracle 9.2.1.0 on Debian GNU/Linux testing
* Oracle 10.1.0.2 on Windows XP and Enterprise Server 2003

If you try this module on any other platforms, any success or failure report
would be greatly appreciated.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

You'll need to have the sqlldr executable somewhere in your path.

You should have the following environment variables set:
  ORACLE_HOME   - the location of the Oracle installation
  ORACLE_SID    - the database instance name
  ORACLE_USERID - the username and password to connect to the database as; the
                  format is username/password (e.g. scott/tiger)

THOUGHTS

I tried to keep this module as simple as possible. It does what I want it to
do, but your definition of "most commonly used functionality" may differ from
mine by quite a bit. I find myself repeating the same tasks regularly, and 90%
of the time I'm just loading a single table from a fixed length file and don't
feel like looking up the exact sqlldr syntax. The SQL*Loader utility, like most
things Oracle, is exteremely well documented, so the I don't see the point in
using a module to generate sqlldr control and parameter files if you've got to
read just as much POD as you would Oracle docs.

This module will never support every obscure option that sqlldr offers. It's
highly unlikely that I'll ever find myself loading LOBs from an auxillary
file, but in the event that I do, I'll add it to the module; patches and
contributions welcome!
